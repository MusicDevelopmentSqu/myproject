# Chinese-COVID19-dashboard
My summer internship project 

Our product is a web-based application that tracks the spread of the recent coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in China. The dashboard is composed of four main modules, namely card module, map module, chart module and table module. The card module will display summary information about how many confirmed, dead and recovered cases in China. In addition, there is a table that contains daily updated information about the coronavirus in each state. The main function of the dashboard is an interactive map that visually displays the distribution of COCID-19 in China. In addition, there are some figures in the chart module, such as a line chart about the timeline of cases and a pie chart of infection rates in various states in China.
